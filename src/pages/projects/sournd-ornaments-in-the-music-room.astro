<p>Commissioned as a site-specific response to the Mansion for the 3rd Tatton Park Biennal 'Flights of Fancy', 'Sound Ornaments in the Music Room' transforms the varied patterns and ornamentations in the Music Room, Library, on the harpsichord and square piano into a filmic notation of sorts. Hypnotic sequences of geometric and biomorphic forms will hover between indecipherable abstraction and a musical script. Extended close-up tracking shots of the elaborate ornaments will create a visual score, to which composer Larry Goves will create a new musical composition. Working with the expertise of Professor Jeanice Brooks from the University of Southampton, the project draws inspiration from one of Tatton's previous residents, Elizabeth Sykes (1777-1853), and her vast collection of music.</p>

      Aura Satz's film and sound works are made in conversation and use dialogue
      as both method and subject matter.

    <p>
      *Little Doorways to Paths Not Yet Taken*. 2016. 8 min. Following Satz's
      earlier films about women composers and inventors of electronic music,
      this short film offers an intimate look into the studio of American
      composer Laurie Spiegel (b. 1945).

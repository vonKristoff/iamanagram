      A short film about the Argentine electroacoustic composer Beatriz
      Ferreyra, an original pioneer of early musique concrete alongside Pierre
      Schaeffer during the '50s and '60s. Here she discusses her 'sound hunting'
      recording techniques, and other thoughts on sound montage and
      spatialization. Featuring creaking doors, barking dogs and rainbow hands.

    <p>
      Aura Satz's film and sound works are made in conversation and use dialogue
      as both method and subject matter. The works included in this show are
      part of a long-standing interest in compositional practices, in particular
      those of women in electronic and electroacoustic music. In addition to
      three film-sound portraits, the exhibition includes a series of drawings
      centred on early modular synthesizer compositional practices by women.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Z Gallery programme, Aura Satz presents the films 'Oramics: Atlantis
      Anew,' 'Little Doorways to Paths Not Yet Take' and 'Hacer una diagonal con
      la musica,' three works based on three pioneers in the field of electronic
      music. 'She Recalibrates' (2018) are a series of drawin fine-tuning the
      sound in a listening feedback loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Hacer una diagonal con la musica*. 2019. 10 min. A short film about
      Argentine electroacoustic composer Beatriz Ferreyra, a pioneer of musique
      concrete together with Pierre Schaeffer during the 1950s and 1960s. Here
      she discusses her 'sound hunting' recording techniques, and other thoughts
      on sound montage and spatialization, illustrated through onomatopoeia and
      dynamic hand gestures. In the key opening scene, Ferreyra is seen
      listening to the miniscule creaks produced by a door, expanding the simple
      binary of open vs closed to encompass an entire sound universe, an
      expanded bandwidth of what can be heard and how we might listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Oramics: Atlantis Anew*. 2011. 7 min. Conceived as an artist's film that
      pays tribute to Daphne Oram, pioneer of British electronic music and
      co-founder of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in 1958, the film depicts a
      close encounter with her unique Oramics machine invention, housed in the
      Science Museum in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      *Little Doorways to Paths Not Yet Taken*. 2016. 8 min. Following Satz's
      earlier films about women composers and inventors of electronic music,
      this short film offers an intimate look into the studio of American
      composer Laurie Spiegel (b. 1945). Renowned for her electronic music
      compositions and algorithmic composition software, the film also reveals
      all manner of musical and technological paraphernalia, ranging from sheet
      music to DIY inventions and collections of quirky toys. The soundtrack
      features electronic music composed by Spiegel and Laurie's voiceover
      reflecting on electronic music and the process of composing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The* Z Gallery* (Z for zinema, cinema in Basque) programme is neither a
      season of films nor an exhibition. It is a project that constructs an
      intermediate space from which to reflect on and draw attention to works by
      artists making the leap into the cinematographic field as well as
      filmmakers exploring the exhibition format. It is a programme arising from
      the determined gesture of thinking about the moving image in the museum. A
      programme that aims to bring to the public authors interested in searching
      for new narrative forms by questioning the genres that historically
      categorise cinematographic language.

      Jo Hutton and Xabier Erkizia.

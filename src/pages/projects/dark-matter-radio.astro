			Tuning Interference on a Dark Matter Radio is a 10-channel sound installation which draws on
			the current quest to find the frequency of a dark matter wave. The project is inspired by the
			description of one of many Dark Matter research initiatives, as 'a radio that looks for a
			radio station, but we don't know its frequency. We turn the knob slowly while listening.
			Ideally we will hear a tone when the frequency is right.' Continuing Satz's investigations
			into sound as a trope for attending to the unsettled and unsettling, the project uses tuning
			and ever-changing recalibration as a compositional approach. In an echo of the open-ended and
			hypothetical state of current research, the project deliberately allows for patterns of
			interference and dissonance. The focus is on the fluctuating dynamic feedback loop between
			experimental listening, apprehending, and potential deciphering, as we reach towards the
			unfamiliar and unknown. The installation features a contained sonic environment in the shape
			of a ring that translates current Dark Matter simulations into sound patterns. The piece
			generates psychoacoustic effects in the listeners, exploring sonic equivalents of interference
			and collision through beat frequencies and other diffractive qualities which shift according
			to the listener's location. The listener becomes a radio dial of sorts, as the ears move
			through the soundscape microtuning with each adjustment. In between each of the 10 spherical
			speakers there are small VU metres, trembling to echo a volatile, dynamic and ever-changing
			frequency field, though what exactly is being measured is uncertain.

			Nearby hangs a photo of Vera Rubin (1928-2016). Rubin was an American astronomer who
			discovered the galaxy rotation problem, providing evidence of the existence of dark matter.
			Here she is seen looking through a spectrograph mounted on the end of the telescope, recording
			an image of the spectrum (colors) of a small section of a galaxy. The image is framed inside a
			fresnel lens, generating a diffractive pattern emanating from the centre.

			The project is the result of a collaboration between Aura Satz and
			cosmologists/astrophysicists Prof. Malcolm Fairbairn (Kings College London), Prof. David J. E.
			Marsh (Goettingen University) and audio engineer/music AI specialist Dr. David Ronan.
			Commissioned by the Science Gallery London, with support in kind from Gallo Acoustics. Built
			by Open Format. Original image of Vera Rubin, reproduced courtesy of Department of Terrestrial
			Magnetism, Carnegie Institution for Science.

		<h3>Exhibtions</h3>
		<Title
			date="6 June â€“ 26 August 2019"
			title="'Dark Matter: 95% of the Universe is Missing'"
			subtitle="Science Gallery London, group show"
		>
			<p>
				In summer 2019, Science Gallery London will explore the elusive building blocks of the
				Universe with DARK MATTER, a free exhibition and events season combining art, physics and
				philosophy, and drawing on the latest research from the Faculty of Natural & Mathematical
				Sciences at King's College London. Exhibition highlights include an immersive animation
				installation by Andy Holden which reflects on the physics of a cartoon landscape, developed
				with Professor John Ellis from the Department of Physics at King's College London;
				translucent spider webs which mimic the structure of dark matter in the universe by Tomas
				Saraceno; a new installation translating dark matter simulations into sound patterns by Aura
				Satz, in collaboration with Professor Malcolm Fairbairn from the Department of Physics at
				King's College London; and; perpetually changing liquid crystal paintings by Agnieszka
				Kurant which will transform according to the 'energy' of social media feeds around the
				world. Curated by Sandra Ross.

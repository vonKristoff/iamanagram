		<p>
			Doorway for Natalie Kalmus is a film centred around the use of colour in moving image
			technology, exploring the disorienting technicolour prismatic effects of the lamp house of a
			35mm colour film printer. Through minute shifts across an abstract colour spectrum, punctuated
			by a mechanical soundtrack, the film evokes kaleidoscopic perceptual after-images (bringing to
			mind Paul Sharits, Dario Argento and the Wizard of Oz). Natalie Kalmus was the ex-wife of
			technicolour inventor Herbert Kalmus, and was the colour consultant for hundreds of colour
			films, including The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind, the Red Shoes, Black Narcissus and many
			more. She would draw up colour scores for each film, like music scores, according to her
			theories of "Colour Consciousness". She also authored a short article entitled "Doorway onto
			another world", in which she described her sisterâ€™s deathbed experience of seeing deceased
			family members.

		<h4>'Soundfigures: Films by Aura Satz'</h4>
		<p>
			A selection of films by Aura Satz, programmed by Michele Smith, DIM Cinema, Vancouver
			Cinametheque
		</p>

		<p>
			(Near) extinct technologies make sound visible in this program of shorts by London-based
			artist Aura Satz that delve into ideas of knowledge, memory, and communication. On a Chladni
			Plate, a device that marked the birth of acoustics, grains of sand, moving like Busby Berkeley
			dancers, form intricate patterns in response to changing sound frequencies, their shapes
			recalling the utopian quest for a 'pure,' onomatopoeic alphabet. Wax cylinder recordings
			combine with modern scientific instruments to animate a text by Rainer Maria Rilke on the
			possibility of hearing the dead by playing their skulls with a gramophone needle. A Ruben's
			Tube translates a histrionic voice-over into a standing wave of small flames, provoking
			unexpected associations, from the biblical burning bush to various acts of ventriloquism in
			pop culture. Breaking its long silence, the Oramics Machine plays hand-drawn compositions by
			its inventor, electronic music pioneer Daphne Oram. Kaleidoscopic effects in the lamphouse of
			a 35mm film printer honour Natalie Kalmus, colour consultant on masterpieces of the
			Technicolor era. Chromatic distortions in early colour-film tests are revealed through the
			eyes of the George Eastman family and old Hollywood stars. In a dramatic finale, Satz and
			experimental filmmaker Lis Rhodes encode their voices as abstract light patterns on 16mm mono
			and 35mm stereo filmstrips in a collaborative exploration of sound-image synchronicity.

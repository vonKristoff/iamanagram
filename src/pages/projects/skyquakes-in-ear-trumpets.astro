			In this multi-channel audio sculpture, ten hearing trumpets flower from the centre of a large
			brass concert phonograph horn like a cornocupia of sounds. While the phonograph horn
			represents a technology of amplification from the sound source outwards, i.e. the horn's
			'throat' towards its 'mouth', the ear trumpets function in the opposite direction, capturing
			sounds inwardly, ear-like. Here both are merged at the service of multi-channel outputs,
			playing an intricate psychoacoustic composition which uses a sine-wave generator to produce
			tones both above and below the threshold of human hearing. The composition features eerie
			tinkling sounds that seem to oscillate within the inner ear, in addition to deeper sirens and
			drones that are evocative of the unexplained trumpet sounds which have been recorded across
			the skies of the world and are thought to mark the end of time according to the Book of
			Revelations. As the sculptural sonic experience spirals around and through the horn mouths,
			the sounds echo the biomorphic shapes of the horns, sliding in and out of the sculpture
			towards the listener's ear.

			'Curiosity: Art and the Pleasures of Knowing' exhibition and performances as part of Hayward
			Touring exhibition in association with Cabinet Magazine, curated by Brian Dillon
		</h3>
		<p>
			Curiosity is an ambiguous passion: the virtuous impulse behind the search for knowledge and at
			the same time a disreputable desire for novelty and strangeness. This exhibition, curated by
			Brian Dillon and organised in association with Cabinet magazine, concentrates on contemporary
			art's return to the intellectual and aesthetic freedom that emerged in seventeenth century art
			and science. Taking the cabinet of curiosities as its founding motif and through a combination
			of contemporary art and historical artefacts, Curiosity explores the pleasure that comes from
			the search for the wondrous and bizarre for their own sake and the contradictory nature of
			that pleasure.

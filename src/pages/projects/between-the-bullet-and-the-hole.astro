      Between the Bullet and the Hole is a new film centred on the elusive and complex effects of war on women's role in ballistic research and early computing. The film features new and archival high speed bullet photography, schlieren and electric spark imagery, bullet sound wave imagery, forensic ballistic photography, slide rulers, punch cards, computer diagrams, and a soundtrack by Scanner. Like a frantic animation storyboard, it explores the flickering space between the frames, testing the perceptual mechanics of visual interpolation, the possibility of reading or deciphering the gap between before and after. Interpolation - the main task of the women studying ballistics in WW2 - is the construction or guessing of missing data using only two known data points. The film tries to unpack this gap, open it up to interrogation. It questions how we read, interpolate or construct the gaps between bullet and hole, perpetrator and victim, presence and absence.

'Her Marks, a Measure'
Solo exhibition at Dallas Contemporary
'Her Marks, a Measure' is an exhibition exploring the role women's labour in astronomy and ballistics. In both these fields women made significant contributions to observation, data collection, and computation. Alongside the film Between the Bullet and the Hole, the show features Her Luminous Distance, a slide-based installation which uses a Blink Comparator, a device used by astronomers to detect small pattern differences between photographic plates by alternately switching between images, blinking back and forth between the two. The PROBLICOM (Projector Blink Comparator) was invented by amateur astronomer Ben Mayer, using two juxtaposed slide projectors and a rotating disc, alternately occulting the images at a stroboscopic pace. The accompanying binaural soundtrack is a pulsing rhythmic drone which plays on the perception of patterns.

Developed from research on the pioneering deaf astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868-1921), the project attends to the lesser known women who contributed to important astronomical discoveries, in particular the women known as 'Human Computers' at Harvard, who were engaged in painstaking astronomical observation and classification. In her extensive studies of Variable Stars, Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relation, which ultimately helped calibrate a method to determine the size of the universe. The blinking slide sequence includes images drawn from Leavitt's original annotated photographic plates of Variable stars, archival images from the Human Computers' workplace, and a series of over 20 images of craters on the moon named after women astronomers. The Leavitt Crater is on the far side of the moon, and is also in honour of deaf scientists.

In addition to the film and slide-based installation the exhibition features circular lenticular prints.

      *Little Doorways to Paths Not Yet Taken*. 2016. 8 min. Following Satz's
      earlier films about women composers and inventors of electronic music,
      this short film offers an intimate look into the studio of American
      composer Laurie Spiegel (b. 1945).

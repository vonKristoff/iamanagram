> WIP: Outline guide to maintaining this project.

### How to build

Goto https://github.com/vonKristoff/iamanagram whereby you have access to make direct edits to the source, by committing the changes. Once done, the site's hosting service will go ahead and publish the changes, where you will be able to see the updates within ~30 secs.

## Images

_Upload your images to the following directories_
(use the gui interface and "add file" in the correct directory)

- home pages: `/public/projects/_thumbnails`
- project pages: `/public/projects`

Using the `<Image />` component on a `project-page.astro`
The image `src` root points to `/public/projects`

```
<Image src="my-file-1" />
```

Otherwise found in the directory as: `/public/projects/my-file-1`

---

However there is nothing stopping you from doing this:

```
<Image src="_thumbnails/my-file-2" />
```

Otherwise found in the directory as: `/public/projects/_thumbnails/my-file-2`

## Page Layout, Content and assets

- `/public/projects`

Directly upload your images for your projects here.

- `/src/content/project/[page-name].md`

This will hold the project's metadata (\*.md) that will configure the following:

```
---
title:
subtitle:
date: 12/2/23 (currently any format tbc)
thumbnail: *.jpg // place in public/_thumbnails
related: ['page-name'] // use any existing <projectname>
category: ['films'] // add more tags if you like
---
```

- `/src/pages/projects/[page-name].astro`

Consider these files as your `*.html` pages, where you will semantically add all of your actual page content and layout.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## Manage a project page

Projects will dynamically build themselves into their respective locations when the following steps are followed:

ðŸ’¡ Metadata `src/content/projects/same-project-name.md` filename **must** match its page layout counterpart: `src/pages/projects/same-project-name.astro`
Otherwise they won't be enabled and embedded into the site's home pages.

Goto `templates/meta` and `templates/page` respectively and copy the blank contents to get started on a new project page, that you can create in the expected location.

Create a new file using the Github IDE.

```yaml
title: The Future Waters of the storm surge..
subtitle: A film featuring sound by BJ Nilsen
date: 12/2/23
thumbnail: JoanArc.jpg // place in public/_thumbnails
related: [] // use any existing <projectname>
category: ['films'] // add more tags if you like
```

## News page items

You can create a new news page item from creating a post in the `src/content/news/*.md` folder. Create the frontmatter as follows:

```yaml
title: Tomorrows news
subtitle: historical influence # optional
date: '2025-09-01' # required in this format
# optional
address: ['Artprojx Space', '53 Beauchamp Place', 'London SW3 1NY', 'Tel: 020 7584 0717']
link: ['my label', 'https://google.com']
archive: false # disables post from showing
```

### FAQs

_How to create a live working link:_
Replace `http://www.paradiserow.com/news/134/` with the following:

```
<a href="http://www.paradiserow.com/news/134/">paradiserow.com</a>
```

- add `target="_blank"` to open in a new window
- add `aria-label="accessible link title"`

_How to update fonts_
We have some basic styles set in the following files:

- `src/styles/global.css`
- `src/styles/fonts.css` - you can change sizes and core colours here

_Where to edit the navigation menu_
Find the `MainHeading` component `src/components/MainHeading.astro` and add or remove accordingly:

```html
<div class="alt-pages">
	<a title="link 1 title" href="https://where.com" target="_blank"> Link 1</a>
	<a title="link 2 title" href="https://where.com" target="_blank">Link 2</a>
</div>
```
